# RPi.GPIO-stubs

Type stubs for [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/).

Function and class docstrings are modified from the original package for clarity and included for language servers to use. See the included [RPi.GPIO license](LICENSE_rpi_gpio).


## Installation

```bash
pip install https://github.com/Sachaa-Thanasius/RPi.GPIO-stubs
```


## Note

Most of this has been pushed upstream to [typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/stubs/RPi.GPIO/RPi/GPIO/__init__.pyi), but this may provide some use due to the included docstrings.
